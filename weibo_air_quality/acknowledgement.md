This project makes use of datasets generously released by researchers and developers of R packages, without which this Shiny application, in itself a testament of the vibrancy of R developer community, would not be possible. I would like to extend my thanks to the following scholars, researchers, and teams whose datasets form an essential part of this application.

### Weiboscope Open Data at Hong Kong University

King-wa Fu, CH Chan, and Michael Chau's amazing Weiboscope Open Dataset provides an interesting glimpse into the dynamic of Chinese Internet and civil society at that time prior to intensified repressions in recent years. With millions rows of records totaling over 45 Gigabyte, he Weiboscope Open Dataset, which encompasses Weibo posts and their matadata in 2012 for Weibo users with a subscriber base larger than 1,000 people, is unparalleled in its detailed recording of information and its special attention on the issue of censorship. 

To access their dataset, please visit https://hub.hku.hk/cris/dataset/dataset107483.

### NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)

NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) observations are used by the researchers to estimate the concentration of fine particulae matters that is smaller than 2.5 milimeter. Such satellite data is not subject to human manipulation and is generally more accurate. 

This project utilizes Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) with GWR, v1 (1998–2016) derived from the previous observations. Ranging from 1998 to 2016, the data, provided in GeoTiff format, present a coherent outlook into the trend of air pollution in China.

### Global Administrative Areas Dataset

This project makes use of Global Administrative Areas (GADM) Dataset to assist in plotting out the boundaries between administrative entities and to categorize the longitude-latitude Weibo geo-location data into specific administrative areas. GADM dataset represents countries' actural control over territory. **The territory presented in the GADM dataset does not reflect this project's view on countries' sovereignty claims or territorial disputes.**
